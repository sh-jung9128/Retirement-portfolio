# Regime-Aware Retirement Portfolio with HMM + CVaR
This repository implements a **dynamic retirement portfolio strategy** that combines **Hidden Markov Models (HMM)** for regime detection with **Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) optimization** for risk-aware asset allocation.  
The goal is to **ensure sustainable cash flows during retirement withdrawals** by adapting portfolio weights to market regimes and incorporating income-oriented assets such as covered call ETFs.
